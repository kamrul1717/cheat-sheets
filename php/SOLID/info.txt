Bad Software Design
--------------------
Sypmtoms of Poor Software design(Design Smell)
 - Rigidity (The design is hard to change)
 - Fragility (The design is easy to break)
 - Immobility (The design is hard to reuse)
 - Software Viscosity (Easier to Hack than normal flow)
 - Enviroment Viscosity (slow and inefficient development enviroment, very long compile times, serveral minutes to deploy)
 - Needless Complexity (Overdesign)
 - Needless Repeatation
 - Opacity (A module is difficult to understand)
